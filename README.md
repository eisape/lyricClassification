# Song Lyric Genre Classifier
A Deep Learning Approach to Genre Classification

Final project for Artificial Intelligence (Professor Sergio Alvarez, Boston College) Tiwalayo Eisape and Shaan Bijwadia

This repository contains Python code to collect and assemble a large dataset of song information using web APIs, and the construction of a neural network for automated classification of songs by genre based on their lyrics.

Various deep learning models were implemented and tested, and natural language processing methods capturing both syntax and semantics were utilized.
The central prediction of the study, that the combination of syntactic and semantic features would outperform syntax or semantics alone, was shown to be correct. The highest-performing network great exceeded human performance, with accuracies above 90%.

For a brief introduction to how the code works, please see startup.py, which contains a basic program showcasing some of the basic tasks involved with the project.
